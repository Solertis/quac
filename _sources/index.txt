Overview
========

Twepi ("Twitter for epidemic analysis") is a package is for acquiring and
analyzing Twitter messages, called *tweets*. It can:

* Reliably collect tweets from the Twitter Streaming API and convert them into
  a convenient TSV format.

* Estimate the origin location of tweets with no geotag.

Each script has pretty nice help which you can print using the ``--help``
option and/or look at in comments at the top of the script. Modules also have
good docstrings.

Note that for many uses of Twepi (especially research) you are ethically
oblicated to cite it. For guidelines on how to do this, see :doc:`citing`.

Twepi is open source under the Apache license.

describes things that reflect the future, not the present. We try to mark such
things, but sometimes we fail.*

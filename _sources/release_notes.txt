Release notes
*************

QUAC releases are more a planning tool than anything else; we try to keep the
``master`` branch stable. That is, there's no real point in favoring a release
tag instead of whatever is on ``master``. All that gets you is an old version.

The future
==========

Planning is done in GitHub. There's no nice view of the key improvements we
envision, though you can see `all the open issues tagged "release driver"
<https://github.com/reidpr/quac/issues?direction=asc&labels=release+driver&milestone=&sort=created&state=open>`_
as well as `planned future releases
<https://github.com/reidpr/quac/issues/milestones?sort=due_dates>`_ (click

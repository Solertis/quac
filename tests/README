These directories contain tests which use the "cmdtest" framework. These are
shell scripts (which might be quite involved); standard output and error are
tested against expected values. "man cmdtest" for the details.

What's here:

  standalone ... tests that require no extra data
  twitter ...... need a small Twitter dataset

Tests that require external data which are not present are skipped. These test
directories contain READMEs with more detail on which data are needed and how
to get them.

A test script can assume that cwd is the directory containing it.

../test.sh runs all tests here. To run just one, cd to the appropriate
subdirectory and say "cmdtest -t foo ."

You might be inclined to use "set -x" in your script to intermingle echoed
commands and output. The problem here is that it's not consistent which
command in a pipeline is printed first, so you'll get spurious failures. You
could try "echo" commands to make the output more digestible.

If cmdtest crashes with "NameError: global name 'errno' is not defined", that
means you need to make your test executable (there is a bug in the error
reporting).

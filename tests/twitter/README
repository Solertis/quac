This directory contains tests that depend on a small data set of about 25,000
tweets. Unlike real data, most of the test tweets are geotagged (specifically,
it seems that we included all tweets which were either geotagged or retweeted
a geotagged tweet). If these data are not present, the tests are skipped.

The file tweets/ids.txt contains the IDs of the tweets in the data set; it is
unfortunately your responsibility to acquire these tweets. A patch
implementing a script to do so (it would take less than two days to request
them individually from the REST API) would be very welcome.

Note that we are flexible as to the specific tweets used, as long as the
tweets appeared in the streaming API spritzer during a period we were
listening. Feel free to adjust the tests to use better-accessible data.
